# Chapter 1: Foundations of NLP

## 1.1 Introduction to NLP

* **[Introduction to Natural Language Processing?](https://github.com/mshojaei77/NLP-Journey/blob/main/ch1/nlp-intro.md)** Explain the core concepts of Natural Language Processing

<sub>Source: [Introduction to Natural Language Processing Lecturer by K.R. Chowdhary](https://krchowdhary.com/nlsp-lect/nlplect-8.pdf)</sub> 

## 1.2 Text Preprocessing

Text preprocessing is a crucial step in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that prepares raw text data for analysis and model training. This section outlines modern techniques and resources relevant to text preprocessing as of 2024.

* **[Tokenization](https://github.com/mshojaei77/NLP-Journey/blob/main/ch1/Tokenization.md):** Breaking text into individual words, which is essential for various NLP tasks.
* **Stemming:** Reducing words to their base or root form (e.g., "running" becomes "run"). This method simplifies the text but may not always yield valid words.
* **Lemmatization:** Converting words to their base form using vocabulary analysis (e.g., "better" becomes "good"). Unlike stemming, lemmatization ensures that the resulting words are valid and contextually appropriate.
* **Stop Word Removal:** Eliminating common words that carry less meaning (e.g., "the", "a", "is") to reduce noise in the data.
* **Punctuation Handling:** Standardizing or removing punctuation to ensure consistency in the text data.
* **Normalization:** Converting text to a standard format, such as lowercasing, removing extra spaces, and correcting misspellings, to improve the quality of the data.
* **Text Augmentation:** Techniques such as synonym replacement, random insertion, or back-translation to artificially expand the training dataset and improve model robustness.
